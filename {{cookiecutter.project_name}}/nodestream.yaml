scopes:
  # The scopes section is used to define pipelines and their respective configuration.
  # Each scope is defined by a unique name and a list of pipeline configurations.
  # The pipelines are configured by pointing to the path of a pipeline configuration file.
  default:
    pipelines:
      - pipelines/sample.yaml

# Plugins are used to extend the functionality of nodestream.
# Each plugin often has its own configruation and targets. 
# You can read more about plugins in the documentation:
# 
#    https://nodestream-proj.github.io/nodestream/0.11.7/docs/guides/project-plugins
#
# The following is an example of a plugin configuration:
# plugins:
#   - name: myplugin
#     config:
#       service_base_url: "https://otherurl.com"
#     targets:
#       - target1
#       - target2
#     pipelines:
#         - name: plugin_pipeline_1
#             exclude_inherited_targets: True
#             annotations:
#                 my_annoation: True
#             targets:
#                 - target3

targets:
  # The Target Section is used to define the targets that the pipelines will use 
  # to store the data. The targets are defined by the setting the database type 
  # and the connection information for the database. The target below is auto-configured
  # with a simple configuration based on your selected database type. You should modify
  # the configuration to match your specific database connection information.
  #
  # For example, the following is a target for a Neo4j database:
  #
  # my-db:
  #   database: neo4j
  #   uri: bolt://localhost:7687
  #   username: neo4j
  #   password: neo4j
  #
  # The following is a target for an Amazon Neptune database:
  #
  # my-db:
  #   database: neptune
  #   host: localhost
  #   region: us-west-2
  my-db:
    database: {{cookiecutter.database}}
    {% if cookiecutter.database == "neo4j" %}uri: bolt://localhost:7687
    username: neo4j
    password: neo4j
    {% elif cookiecutter.database == "neptune" %}host: localhost
    region: us-west-2
    {% endif %}
